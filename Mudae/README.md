Python script to generate commands in order to create and maintain an ordered mymarry list for the discord Mudae Bot. Don't ask why I made this.

Usage:

1. Create a waifulist.txt file and populate it with characters from Mudae, in the order you wish to sort them by.

Megumi Katou - Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata
Remilia Scarlet - Touhou Project (Windows Canon)

2. Use the command $mms and copy and paste the output sent to mms_output.txt

3. Run generate_commands.py

4. From the waifulist_commands.txt file, copy and paste the $l commands for likelist, and $note for notes. The notes must be specified for ordering of notes.

5. Run generate_sort.py

6. From the sort_command.txt file, copy and paste the command and send it to Mudae

generate_owned.py exists to create a file, ownedlist.txt for use with any further parsing
