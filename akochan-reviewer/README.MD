**Windows Only**

Basic python script to format input to [akochan-reviewer](https://github.com/Equim-chan/akochan-reviewer). This script saves a very small amount of time spent typing, assuming that the same flags are provided each time. At the moment, the only supported flags are `--lang en` and `--without viewer`.

Directory structure is above akochan-reviewer, hence the `cd akochan-reviewer` in the command line.

Usage:
Edit file `review.txt` which is generated on first run. Paste url to replay.

**default review.txt**
`en=true`
`viewer=true`
