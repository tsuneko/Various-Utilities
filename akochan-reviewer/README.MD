2. Extract the zip file
3. Right click this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsuneko/Various-Utilities/master/akochan-reviewer/review.bat) and click Save-Link-As, and save in the same directory as akochan-reviewer
4. Run review.bat, copy the match replay link from either Tenhou or Mahjong Soul, and right click in the window to paste and hit enter.

If you wish to see the embedded preview, then edit the `review.bat` file and remove this part: `--without-viewer`.
If you wish to see the output in Japanese, then edit the `review.bat` file and remove this part: `--lang en`.
