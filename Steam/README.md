## steam-clean-userdata.py

Since I've logged into quite a lot of Steam accounts on my PC, my userdata folder became littered with accounts. Since the game I primarily play is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, I wrote this script to delete any userdata directories which do not have any screenshots saved for the game, as a simple way of determining the importance of the userdata files.
